This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector through a raw pointer after its ownership has changed, which can lead to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows a corrected version of the code that avoids this error. This example highlights the importance of careful memory management and understanding of ownership in Rust when using unsafe operations.
